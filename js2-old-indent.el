;;; Commentary:

;; All features of this indentation code have been ported to Emacs's
;; built-in `js-mode' by now, so we derive from it.  An older
;; commentary follows.

;; This code is kept for Emacs 24.5 and ealier.

;; This indenter is based on Karl Landstr√∂m's "javascript.el" indenter.
;; Karl cleverly deduces that the desired indentation level is often a
;; function of paren/bracket/brace nesting depth, which can be determined
;; quickly via the built-in `parse-partial-sexp' function.  His indenter
;; then does some equally clever checks to see if we're in the context of a
;; substatement of a possibly braceless statement keyword such as if, while,
;; or finally.  This approach yields pretty good results.

;; The indenter is often "wrong", however, and needs to be overridden.
;; The right long-term solution is probably to emulate (or integrate
;; with) cc-engine, but it's a nontrivial amount of coding.  Even when a
;; parse tree from `js2-parse' is present, which is not true at the
;; moment the user is typing, computing indentation is still thousands
;; of lines of code to handle every possible syntactic edge case.

;; In the meantime, the compromise solution is that we offer a "bounce
;; indenter", configured with `js2-bounce-indent-p', which cycles the
;; current line indent among various likely guess points.  This approach
;; is far from perfect, but should at least make it slightly easier to
;; move the line towards its desired indentation when manually
;; overriding Karl's heuristic nesting guesser.

;; I've made miscellaneous tweaks to Karl's code to handle some Ecma
;; extensions such as `let' and Array comprehensions.  Major kudos to
;; Karl for coming up with the initial approach, which packs a lot of
;; punch for so little code. -- Steve
